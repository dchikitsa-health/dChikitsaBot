# dChikitsa Telegram Bot

- To begin with simply put your Telegram Authorization Token into the [application.properties](https://github.com/dchikitsa-health/dChikitsaTelegramBot/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.

- Integrate the Bot with DHP, and you can easily change the [Bot Class](https://github.com/dchikitsa-health/dChikitsaTelegramBot/blob/main/src/main/java/com/dchikitsa/dhp/service/Bot.java) and customise the behaviour.
